1. How to build WSF/PHP under Windows from source

    a. Requirements

	You need to download following dependency libraries:

	libxml2 binary distribution   
    iconv binary distribution
	OpenSSL binary distribution
	PHP Source
	PHP Binary
	Win32build [ win32 buildtools for PHP ]
	Mysql Server 5 [When using Reliable Messaging With MySql Database ]

	In addition you need to have visual studio installed on your system.
	
	obtain libxml2 and iconv win32 binaries from [1].
	obtain OpenSSL binary from [2] [the build system assumes that you install openssl from msi].
	obtain MySql Server from [3].
	obtain PHP Source and Bianry from [4].
	obtain Win32Build from [5].

	[5] http://www.php.net/extra/win32build.zip 

        
    b. WSF/PHP extension is build on top of WSF/C Web Services Framework. The extension source code
       is packaged with WSF/C code. When you download the wso2-wsf-php-src.zip file, it will contain
       following dirctory structure.
	
   wso2-wsf-php-src
        |
        +--- src
	    |
	    +--- wsf_c
	    |
	    +--- docs
	    |
	    +--- samples
	    |
	    +--- scripts
         
       In the wso2-wsf-php-src directory you will find a file named configure.in file. Open this file
       and set your dependency directory locations to relevent entries. You can build with debug symbol
       by setting DEBUG=1 option.
	
       Next run the build.bat file located in wso2-wsf-php-src directory. It should build the binary dist pack
       to the same directory.

       ( Before running the build.bat file, add your vcvars32.bat file location to PATH environment variable. 
	    If you are using vc2005, it is located in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\bin)

     c. Building using PHP win32 build system
 
       There is another way of building the WSF/PHP extension. For this you will first need to build php
       from source under windows.please refer README.WIN32-BUILD-SYSTEM
       file in PHP source distribution and build PHP source under Windows.

       You will also need wso2-wsf-c binary in order to build using this technique.
                
       Copy wsf_php folder to php_source/ext directory.

       Run "buildconf.bat" to rebuild the configure.js file.


       "cscript /nologo configure.js --help" will give the configuration options.
       You will find the option --with-wsf.

       Add following entries to config.nice.bat file.
	"--with-extra-includes=<Libxml2 bin dir>\include;<Iconv bin dir>\include;<wsf-c>\include;
		<wsf-c-bin>\include;"
	"--with-extra-libs=<Libxml2 bin dir>\lib;<Iconv bin dir>\lib;<wsf-c>\lib;<wsf-c-bin>\lib"
	--with-wsf=shared"

	Now run config.nice.bat file to generate the makefile.
   
	"nmake" will build wsf extension.

2. Installing WSO2 WSF as a PHP extension.

    1.If you built the extension from the source, you will find the wso2-wsf-php-bin-x.y.z-win32 (binary pack) 
      located in your source directory.
      
        You can get the binary pack by downloading and extracting the binary distribution as well. 

        It will have the following structure

        wso2-wsf-php-bin-x.y.z-win32
               |
               +-- wsf_c
               |
               +-- wsf.dll
               |
               +-- docs
               |
               +-- scripts
               |
               +-- samples 

    2. Copy wsf.dll to the <PHP installation directory>/ext directory.

    3. Add wso2-wsf-php-bin-x.y.z-win32\wsf_c\lib directory to the PATH environment variable.

    4. Add the above listed dependency library dlls to the PATH environment variable.

    5. Add the following entries to your php.ini file which is in your PHP installation location.
    
    [wsf]
    wsf.home="<path_to_extract_folder>\wsf_c"
    wsf.log_path="<path to extract_folder>\wsf_c\logs"
    wsf.log_level=3

    extension=wsf.dll

    Set entension_dir entry to your extensions directory.

    extension_dir ="./ext"

    Also enable php_xsl extension

    extension = php_xsl.dll

    Uncomment the include_path and edit it to point to the location for scripts folder as

    include_path = ".;/<path to the scripts folder>"

    6. Configure the Apache2 Web server with PHP as follows.

        6.1. Copy php5apache2.dll to Apache2/modules directory and add the following entries in httpd.conf file.

            LoadModule php5_module modules/php5apache2.dll
            PHPIniDir "< your php.ini file location> "

            AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml
            AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

    7. Copy the samples folder to your Apache Web server's document root. If you want to run samples

    Now you should be able to run the samples in the samples directory.

3. Binary Dependency version numbers.

  WSO2-WSF-PHP-1.2.2 Win32 Binary Will be compiled using following version of dependency libraries.

  1. PHP     5.2.5
  2. Libxml2 2.6.30
  3. Iconv   1.9.2 
  4. openssl .98e (MSI)
