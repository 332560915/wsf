===========================================================

1. How to build PHP under Windows.
    Please refer to README.WIN32-BUILD-SYSTEM file that comes 
    with PHP source distribution.

2. How to build wsf_c under Windows from source

    a. Requirements

	You need to download following:

	libxml2 binary distribution
      zlib binary distribution
      iconv binary distribution
	OpenSSL binary distribution
        
    b. Using the command prompt            

	If you have Visual Studio command prompt, open it and change 
	directory to "wsf_c/axis2c/build/win32" of the extract folder.
	
	If not, create a new shortcut and set target to:
	
	%comspec% /k "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\bin\vcvars32.bat"
	
	Now change directory to "wsf_c/axis2c/build/win32" and edit 
	the configure.in file and set your binary installation 
	locations of libxml2, zlib and iconv libraries.

	Similarly you will need to edit the configure.in files in rampartc and sandesha2
	directories. They run the build.bat file in wso2-wsf-php-src-1.0alpha2 directory.
                    
  	This will build the binary to wso2-wsf-php-src-1.0alpha2 directory.

3. Building WSO2 WSF
                
    Before trying this, please refer README.WIN32-BUILD-SYSTEM
    file in PHP source distribution and build PHP source under Windows.
                
    Copy wsf_php folder to php_source/ext directory.

    Run "buildconf.bat" to rebuild the configre.js file.


    "cscript /nologo configure.js --help" will give the configuration options.
    You will find the option --with-wsf.

    Add following entries to config.nice.bat file.
	"--with-extra-includes=<Libxml2 bin dir>\include;<Iconv bin dir>\include;<zlib bi dir>\include;<wsf-c>\include;"
	"--with-extra-libs=<Libxml2 bin dir>\lib;<Iconv bin dir>\lib;<zlib bin dir>\lib;<wsf-c>\lib"
	--with-wsf=shared"

	
    Now run config.nice.bat file to generate the makefile.
   
    "nmake" will build wsf extension.

4. Installing WSO2 WSF as a PHP extension.

    If you have build from the source you should now have the
    	
	wsf_c binary and the php_wsf.dll.

    If you have extracted the binary you should have the following structure.

    wso2_wsf_1.0.alpha1-bin
                |  
	    	    +-- wsf_c 
	            |
                +-- php_wsf.dll
                      

    1. Copy php_wsf.dll to PHP installation directory.
    
    2. Add wsf_c\lib directory to path.

    3. Add the following entries to your php.ini file which is in your PHP 
       installation location.
       [wsf]
       wsf.home="<path_to_extract_folder>\wsf_c"                       
       wsf.log_path="<path_to_extract_folder>\wsf_c\logs"
       wsf.rm_db_dir="<path_to_extract_folder>\wsf_c>"

       extension=php_wsf.dll
     
    5. Create an environment variable PHPRC to point to your php.ini file location.

    6. Configure the Apache2 Web server with PHP as follows.
       
       Copy php5apache2.dll to Apache2/modules directory.
       Add following entries in httpd.conf file.

       LoadModule php5_module modules/php5apache2.dll
       
       AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml
       AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
                              
    7. Copy the wsf.php script and all the samples to your Web server's document root
    
    Now you should be able to run the samples in samples directory.
