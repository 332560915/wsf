Building and Installing WSO2 WSF/C++ from Source on Linux.
==========================================================

   1. Extract the source tar package to a folder.

   2. Set WSFCPP_HOME environment variable pointing to the location where you want to install WSO2 WSF/C++.

        $ WSFCPP_HOME='/your_desired_path_to_wsf_c++_installation'
        $ export WSFCPP_HOME

   3. Then go to the folder where you extracted the source.

        $ cd /your_path_to_wsf_c++_source

   4. Build the source
      * This can be done using the following command sequence in the directory where you have extracted the source

        $  ./configure --prefix=${WSFCPP_HOME}
        $ make
        $ make install
        $ make examples

   5. Go to where you installed WSO2 WSF/C++.
      Start simple axis server * To start the simple axis server on port 9090 run the following commands

        $ cd ${WSFCPP_HOME}/bin
        $ ./axis2_http_server

      To see the possible command line options run ./axis2_http_server -h Note : If you run into shared library problems, try setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH

        $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${WSFCPP_HOME}/lib

Now you are ready to use WSO2 WSF/C++.

Notes:
 - You may require super user privileges to run 'make install' on your system.
 - You may optionally specify the path in which the installation should be 
   deployed using './configure --prefix=PATH'.
 - If you don't provide the --prefix configure option, WSO2 WSF/C++ will by 
   default be installed into, '/opt/wso2/wsf_cpp'
 - You may run './configure --help' for more information on configure options.
