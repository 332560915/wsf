            Web Services Framework (Perl extension) - WSF/Perl
	    --------------------------------------------------

What it is?
-----------

WSF/Perl is Perl language bindings to WSO2 WSF/C.

Installation
------------

This extension is still in very early stage of development and is incomplete.
Here's how you could play around with it if your're still interested.

1.  Edit install.sh with your favourite text editor.

2.  Change LIB and give the folder that you want the Perl libraries to be
    installed.  Since the extension is in its very early stages in the
    development it's advisable not to install it to your standard folder
    that Perl extensions are installed.

3.  Change LIBS to point to the folder you installed WSF/C libraries.

4.  Change INC to point to the folder you installed WSF/C headers.

5.  Execute install.sh script.
