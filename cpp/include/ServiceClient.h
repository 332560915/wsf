     * @brief class ServiceClient The service client interface serves as the primary client
     * interface for consuming services. The Service Client is
     * derived either from the repository, or by using a configuration
     * context. Optionally, you can pass options during the
     * initialization. You also can explicitly set options. Advanced
     * features such as engaging and disengaging modules, adding and
     * removing headers are supported. Some methods in the client may
     * throw exceptions identified as Axis Faults. There are several
     * ways of invoking a service operation, which are based on the
     * concept of a message exchange pattern (MEP). The two basic MEPs
     * supported by service client are out-only and out-in. Each MEP
     * can be used in either blocking or non-blocking mode. The operation
     * invocations using the service client API are based on the
     * XML-in/XML-out principle: both the payload to be sent to the
     * service and the result from the service are in XML, represented
     * in AXIOM.
