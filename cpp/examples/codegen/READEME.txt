Sample: Calculator
====================

Introduction
------------

This samples demonstrate the use of code generation using WSF/CPP codegeneration tool with
which is based on Axis2/Java codegeneration tools (http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/webservices/axis2/trunk/java)
tool with Axis Data Binding. 

Files
-----
-Calculator
	Client source       ./Calculator/CalculatorAdd.cpp
	Service Source	    ./Calculator/CalculatorSkeleton.cpp
	wsdl		    ./Calculator/Calculator.wsdl


Code Generation
---------------

Use the shell script or batch file available in the <WSFCPP_HOME>/tools/codegen/wsdl2cpp/ directory to generate
code using following options.(Reade the READEME.txt at wsdl2cpp directory to learn how to use scripts

Client side stub generation with Axis Data Binding:
	Linux: WSDL2CPP.sh -uri <wsdl path> -g -d adb -u -f -o <output directory> 
	Win32: WSDL2CPP.bat -uri <wsdl path> -g -d adb -u -f -o <output directory> 

Server side skeleton generation with Axis Data Binding:
	Linux: WSDL2CPP.sh -uri <wsdl path> -sd -ss -d adb -u -f -o <output directory>
	Win32: WSDL2CPP.bat -uri <wsdl path> -sd -ss -d adb -u -f -o <output directory>

Description of Options used:
	
    -o <output Location> : output file location
    -ss : Generate server side code (i.e. skeletons). Default is off
    -sd : Generate service descriptor (i.e. services.xml). Default is off. Valid with -ss
    -d <databinding> : valid databinding is adb. 
    -g : Generates all the classes. valid only with the -ss (This will generate client and server codes)
    -u : unpacks the databinding classes
    -f : Generate the source output folder without the src directory

Please refer to the http://ws.apache.org/axis2/tools/1_1/CodegenToolReference.html for further details.

Deploying the Service
---------------------
You need to generate the required server side code using command described above and replace 
the <service name>Skeleton.cpp with given implementation. 
If  you are on linux, the build.sh script will pack the lib<Service Name>.so along with the services.xml to 
a directory named <Service Name>. Put this directory inside $AXIS2C_HOME/services/ directory.

You need to then startup the server to deploy the service.

On windows, you can use visual studio to complile the client and the service. Just replace the generated CalculatorSkeleton.cpp 
with the file in the service directory. For the preprocessor options, add the macro AXIS2_DECLARE_EXPORT. In the linker options
add the libraries, wso2_wsf.lib axiom.lib axutil.lib axis2_engine.lib. 

Running the Client
------------------
You need to generate the required client side code using command described above and put them inside 
where client implementations resides. And then build the client and run it. Add the above mentions libs to the linker option.
