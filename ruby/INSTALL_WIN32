1. How to build WSF/Ruby under Windows from source

    a. Requirements

	You need to download following dependency libraries:

	libxml2 binary distribution   
        iconv binary distribution
	OpenSSL binary distribution
	Ruby Binary (One click installer is prefereble)
	Mysql Server 5 [When using Reliable Messaging With MySql Database ]

	In addition you need to have visual studio installed on your system.
	
	obtain libxml2 and iconv win32 binaries from [1].
	obtain OpenSSL binary from [2] [the build system assumes that you install openssl from msi].
	obtain MySql Server from [3].
	obtain Ruby Bianry from [4].

2. Installing WSO2 WSF as a Ruby extension.

    Now you should have the wso2-wsf-ruby binary pack with following structure.
    ( you can get the binary from the .zip binary pack or building from the source )

    wso2-wsf-ruby-bin-1.1.0-win32
                |  
	    	    +-- wsf_c
                |
                +-- doc
	          |
                +-- samples
                |
		    +-- lib
                      

    1. Execute install.rb file. (run "ruby install.rb" without quotes)
    
    2. Add wsf_c\lib directory to PATH environment variable.

    3. Add the following entries to your rbconfig.rb file which is in your ruby installation location.

       (use '/' to seperate directories. e.g. "E:/install/wsfc")
  
  		CONFIG["WSFC_HOME"] = "/your/wsfc/home/"
	      CONFIG["WSF_LOG_DIR"] = "/where/the/log/files/should/reside/"
	      CONFIG["WSF_LOG_LEVEL"] = "3"
    
		Valid Log Levels - 
	      	"0" - CRITICAL
		  	"1" - ERROR
		  	"2" - WARNING
		  	"3" - INFO
		  	"4" - DEBUG
		  	"5" - TRACE
	
    		NOTE : run "ruby find_rbconfig.rb" in a console to find where this file is.
           	
    4. Now you should be able to run the samples in samples directory. 
                         		 	
3. Binary Dependency version numbers.

  WSO2-WSF-Ruby-1.0.0 Win32 Binary Will be compiled using following version of dependency libraries.

  1. Ruby    1.8.6
  2. Libxml2 2.6.30
  3. Iconv   1.9.2 
  4. openssl .98d (MSI)
