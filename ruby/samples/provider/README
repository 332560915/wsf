REAME for Service deployment with Rails
======================================

First you need to build a rails application to deploy the samples mentioned here.
To build an application follow the following steps.

1. Go to a directory where you want to start the rails application.

2. Run the following command.
        rails your_rails_application. 
   Here on, the term 'your_rails_application' should be renamed to the name of your application.

3. cd your_rails_application.

4. There you will find the following directory structure. (only app sub directory is shown here)

 -- app
     |
     +-- controllers
     |
     +-- views

5. Then copy the files of the relevent sample to the app/controllers directory of your rails application.
For an example, for Echo Sample you will copy echo_service_controller.rb to the app/controllers so the
directory strcutre after copying the Echo sample

 -- app
     |
     +-- controllers
     |       |
     |       +-- echo_service_controller.rb
     |
     +-- views

6. Then run the ./script/server from the root directory of your rails application to run the server. Then
the services will be deployed automatically.

7. Now you can try the services with your client using following endpoint addresses.
