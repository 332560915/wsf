1. How to build WSF/PHP under Windows from source

    a. Requirements

	You need to download following dependency libraries:

	libxml2 binary distribution   
        zlib binary distribution
        iconv binary distribution
	OpenSSL binary distribution
	PHP Source
	PHP Binary
	Win32build [ win32 buildtools for PHP ]
	Mysql Server 5 [When using Reliable Messaging With MySql Database ]

	In addition you need to have visual studio installed on your system.
	
	obtain libxml2, zlib, and iconv win32 binaries from [1].
	obtain OpenSSL binary from [2] [the build system assumes that you install openssl from msi].
	obtain MySql Server from [3].
	obtain PHP Source and Bianry from [4].
	obtain Win32Build from [5].

    b. WSF/PHP extension is build on top of WSF/C Web Services Framework. The extension source code
       is packaged with WSF/C code. When you download the wso2-wsf-php-src.zip file, it will contain
       following dirctory structure.
	
       wso2-wsf-php-src
         |
         +--- src
	 |
	 +--- wsf_c
	 |
	 +--- docs
	 |
	 +--- samples
	 |
	 +--- scripts
         
       In the wso2-wsf-php-src directory you will find a file named configure.in file. Open this file
       and set your dependency directory locations to relevent entries. You can build with debug symbol
       by setting DEBUG=1 option.
	
       Next run the build.bat file located in wso2-wsf-php-src directory. It should build the binary dist pack
       to the same directory.

       ( Before running the build.bat file, add your vcvars32.bat file location to PATH environment variable. 
	If you are using vc2005, it is located in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\bin)

     c. Building WSO2 WSF/PHP with php win32 build system
 
       There is another way of building the WSF/PHP extension. For this you will first need to build php
       from source under windows.please refer README.WIN32-BUILD-SYSTEM
       file in PHP source distribution and build PHP source under Windows.

       You will also need wso2-wsf-c binary in order to build using this technique.
                
       Copy wsf_php folder to php_source/ext directory.

       Run "buildconf.bat" to rebuild the configre.js file.


       "cscript /nologo configure.js --help" will give the configuration options.
       You will find the option --with-wsf.

       Add following entries to config.nice.bat file.
	"--with-extra-includes=<Libxml2 bin dir>\include;<Iconv bin dir>\include;<zlib bi dir>\include;<wsf-c>\include;
		<wsf-c-bin>\include;"
	"--with-extra-libs=<Libxml2 bin dir>\lib;<Iconv bin dir>\lib;<zlib bin dir>\lib;<wsf-c>\lib;<wsf-c-bin>\lib"
	--with-wsf=shared"

	Now run config.nice.bat file to generate the makefile.
   
	"nmake" will build wsf extension.

2. Installing WSO2 WSF as a PHP extension.

    Now you should have the wso2-wsf-php binary pack with following structure.
    ( you can get the binary from the .zip binary pack or building from the source )

    wso2-wsf-php-bin-1.1.0-win32
                |  
	    	+-- wsf_c
                |
                +-- wsf.dll
	        |
                +-- samples
                |
		+-- scripts
                      

    1. Copy wsf.dll to PHP installation directory.
    
    2. Add wsf_c\lib directory to PATH environment variable.

    3. Add the following entries to your php.ini file which is in your PHP 
       installation location.
       [wsf]
       wsf.home="<path_to_extract_folder>\wsf_c"                       
       wsf.log_path="<path_to_extract_folder>\wsf_c\logs"
       wsf.rm_db_dir="<path_to_extract_folder>\wsf_c>"
       wsf.log_level = 3
       extension=wsf.dll

       set extension_dir entry to point to you php extensions location. This is <PHP Binary Directory>/ext.
       extension_dir="./ext"

       Also enable php xsl extension.
       extension="php_xsl.dll"

       Uncomment the "include_path" and edit it to point to the location for scripts folder as

       include_path = ".;/path/to/scripts/folder" 
        
       [Note] Log level is by default set to INFO. Log levels range from 0 to 4. Log levels are as follows.
	      CRITICAL->  0 , ERROR -> 1 , WARNING -> 2 , INFO -> 3, DEBUG -> 4
     
    4. Configure the Apache2 Web server with PHP as follows.
       
       Copy php5apache2.dll to Apache2/modules directory (If your Apache2 service is of Apache 2.2.X family, use
	php5apache2_2.dll) .

       Add following entries in httpd.conf file.

       LoadModule php5_module modules/php5apache2.dll
       
       PHPIniDir <your php.ini file location>
       
       AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml
       AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

       Now you should be able to run the samples in samples directory. 
                         		 	
3. Binary Dependency version numbers.

  WSO2-WSF-PHP-1.2.0 Win32 Binary Will be compiled using following version of dependency libraries.

  1. PHP     5.2.5
  2. Libxml2 2.6.30
  3. Iconv   1.9.2 
  4. zlib    1.2.3
  5. openssl .98e (MSI)
